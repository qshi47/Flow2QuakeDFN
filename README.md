## Introduction
Flow2QuakeDFN, based on the latest version (1.2.0) of [Quake-DFN](https://github.com/limkjae/Quake-DFN), simulates earthquake rupture driven by changes in reservoir pore pressure. The underlying physics involves the coupling between reservoir pore pressure, reservoir poro-elastic stress, and fault rate-and-state rupture dynamics. This code can generate both injection-induced  ([video 1](#injection-rupture)) and depletion-induced ([video 2](#depletion-rupture)) earthquake rupture.

## Workflow

We use `Example`, a simpler depletion-induced case, to demonstrate the workflow. We first generate multiple cuboids that consist the reservoir. A pore pressure generator then gives the spatial heterogeneous and temporal evolving pore pressure in each cuboid. After assigning the fault geometry, elastic modulus and rupture mode, a poro-elastic stress calculator computes the corresponding external shear and normal stresses on each fault patch. Finally, we set the initial stress and initial rate-and-state parameters on fault before running the quasi-dynamic Quake-DFN simulation.  


### Reservoir Cuboids
Create the cuboids for the reservoir. In this example, the reservoir consists of a single cuboid.
```
julia CuboidCoupling/Example/Generate_Cuboids.jl
```

This generates the file containing the position and size of each cuboid `CuboidCoupling/Input_Cuboids.txt`.

### Reservoir Pore Pressure
Assign the temporal pore pressure change in each reservoir cuboid and the corresponding external time. 

```
julia CuboidCoupling/Example/Generate_PorePressure.jl
``` 

The external time and pore pressure changes are stored in  `CuboidCoupling/Input_PorePressureChange.txt`.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use your own mesh-generator and pore pressure solver code to produce `CuboidCoupling/Input_Cuboids.txt` and `CuboidCoupling/Input_PorePressureChange.txt`, as long as their formats remain the same as provided.



### Fault Geometry
Build the bulk fault geometry, including fault geometry, elastic modulus and rupture mode. In this example, the fault is a 70Â° dipping normal fault that cuts the reservoir with no offset.

```
julia CuboidCoupling/Example/Build_Geometry_Single_Normal.jl
```

Discretize the fault, pre-calculate and store the static stress interaction between each fault patch.
```
julia RUN_BUILD_INPUT.jl
```


### Fault Poro-elastic Stress Change



```
julia CuboidCoupling/CalculatePoroElasticStress.jl
```

This file reads `CuboidCoupling/Input_Cuboids.txt`, `CuboidCoupling/Input_PorePressureChange.txt` and `Input_Discretized.jld2`, calculates the resulting poro-elastic external stress changes on each fault patch at each (prescribed) time, and  generates `Input_ExternalStressChange.jld2`, which contains the computed external fault shear and effective normal stress and is loaded when running the Quake-DFN simulation. In addition, you need to manually specify the criterion for which fault patches experience pore pressure and therefore have effective normal stress $\sigma' = \sigma - P$.

### Fault Initial Condition
The initial fault conditions can be set in either `CuboidCoupling/Example/Build_Geometry_Single_Normal.jl` or `QuickParameterAdjust.jl`. We recommend systematically set all initial fault stress and rate-and-state parameters in `QuickParameterAdjust.jl`, since it overwrites the initial condition written in the former file. This file is executed automatically when running the Quake-DFN simulation.
