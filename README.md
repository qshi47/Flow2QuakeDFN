## Introduction
This project simulates earthquake rupture driven by changes in reservoir pore pressure. The physics underlying involves the coupling between reservoir pore pressure, poro-elastic stress, and rate-and-state fault dynamics. We use the case `Example` to demonstrate the workflow: fluid is injected into a flat reservoir and induces rupture on a planar, dipping fault offset from the injection point. The movie below illustrates the coupled processes and is produced at the end of the workflow.

## Workflow
### Reservoir Mesh 
Create a computational mesh for the reservoir. In this example, the reservoir consists of a 40 Ã— 40 grid of **cuboid** elements.
```
python ReservoirMeshExamples/Example_Generate_Cubes.py
```


You can check the positions of all the reservoir cubes via the *Input_Example_Cubes.txt* file:

### Reservoir Pore Pressure
Assign the time and pore pressure change for each reservoir cuboid. 

```
julia PorePressureExamples/Example_Injection.jl
``` 

You can check the pore pressure changes at each time in each reservoir cube in *Input_Example_PorePressureChange.csv*.

### Fault Geometry
Build the bulk fault geometry.

```
julia InputGeometryExamples/Example_BuildGeometry_Single_Normal.jl
```

Discretize the fault and generate the fault meshes.
```
julia RUN_BUILD_INPUT.jl
```

### Fault Initial Stress
Set the initial shear&normal stresses on each fault patch in *QuickParameterAdjust.jl*. This file is executed automatically when running the QuakeDFN simulation `RUN_QUAKEDFN.jl`.

### Fault Poro-elastic Stress Change
Compute the resulting poroelastic stress changes on each fault patch at each (prescribed) time step. 


```
julia ExternalStressCalculationExamples/Example_PoroStress.jl
```

This generates the *Input_ExternalStressChange.jld2* file, which contains the computed fault external shear and effective normal stress. *Plot_InitialStress.ipynb* file provides the necessary code to visualize these external stresses.
